    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Iâ€™m Jeremy Barkley. I am a Systems admin for OpenVMS and RedHat Linux systems and freelance web
       developer living in the Texas Panhandle. I have had an interest in web development and design since as far back as high school when I built a website with 
       some friends. The technology has changed a lot and that actually makes me very happy.</p>
        
    <p>In my free time (when i can find it), I also enjoy creating objects in 3d using Blender 3d, 
        as well as CrossFit, spending time with family and being outdoors.</p>
