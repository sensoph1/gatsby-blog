I have decided to recreate my mostly unused website using Gatsby and React. This is pretty much all brand new and i hope to be able to share some of my successes and failures as I go. Hopefully i can keep it going.

I pretty much used the 'gatsby fundamentals + intermediate tutorials'  from the gatsbyjs website. I may add in a cms from netlify but im not sure.

Below is just a screenshot of where I started since its going to be a WIP.
